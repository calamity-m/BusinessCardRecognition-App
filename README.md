# BusinessCardRecognition-App

TODO: Needs to be altered from website

- Complete Android Application
- Use of Google's Vision API
- Basic Database Use

Created an Android Application in Android Studio. The Application primarily uses Google's Vision API to read photos of Business Cards, which are then run through an algorithm which extracts the relevant information and categorises it. Additionally the application also implements saving and loading of read business cards, as well as toasts, menus and settings.
