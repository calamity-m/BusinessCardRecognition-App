- Complete Android Application
- Microsoft's Computer Vision API
- Basic Database Use

Created an Android Application in Android Studio. The Application primarily uses Microsoft's Computer Vision API to read photos of Business Cards, which are then run through an algorithm which extracts the relevant information and categorises it. Additionally the application also implements saving and loading of read business cards, as well as toasts, menus and settings.
